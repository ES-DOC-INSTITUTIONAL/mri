Both the ice albedo and the snow albedo are estimated. The sea-ice surface albedo is determined as an average weighted by the snow cover percentage, which depends on the snow amount. However, the parameterization of Aoki and Tanaka (2008), who account for the albedo decline due to pollution by aerosol deposition, is applied to the estimation of snow albedo. Moreover, the effect of permeation on albedo is taken into account for both ice and snow for visible and near-infrared wavelengths, respectively."
